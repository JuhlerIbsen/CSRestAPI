# Movie RestAPI

This is an extension of <a href="https://github.com/JuhlerIbsen/CSMovieManager" target="_blank">my compulsory assignment.</a>.<br>
We are told to replace the ConsoleUI with a RestAPI, that should handle c.r.u.d operations.

| API           | Description   | C.R.U.D   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----: |
| POST   | Sumbits Data         | Create |
| GET    | Requests Data        | Read   |
| PUT    | Updates Data         | Update |
| DELETE | Deletes Data         | Delete |


## First milestone
##### Initial implementation
1. Create a new Solution from your Template
2. Add the new solution to a new Repository on GitHub
3. Add a Rest API and Test it with Postman
4. Video 16+ (Just if you are already done)
   1. Change your POST Method in the Values so it can accept a Video Object
   2. Try to send a Video as JSON from postman to your Rest API
   
## Second milestone
##### Final implementation
1. Change your POST Method in the ValuesController so it can accept a Video Object
2. Try to send a Video as JSON from postman to your Rest API
3. Create a VideoController
4. Test your REST API (Video Route) with postman (CRUD)
5. Start implementing more entities in your system (No relations)
   1. You can use <a href="https://imgur.com/a/zR5Fk" target="_blank">Suggestion for a Database (Video Rental)</a> or create a database diagram to work with yourself (LJB need to approve if you make one yourself)
   
   
### Building a REST API in NET Core (Tutorial)
My teacher have created a series of videos to help us out. If you follow his series, then you will end out with a project similar to mine.
